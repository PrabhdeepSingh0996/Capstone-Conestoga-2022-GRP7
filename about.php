            G1 Boost began as a learning strategy for G1 exams in Ontario using quizes to help people prepare. We as a started this project because we wanted to help people learn about the test in an interactive way by simulating the process.

            G1 Boost serves a quiz application which helps the users understand the the test by practicing hands on in it. We are using the official G1 Ontario quiz sample papers to generate the questions so the quiz is very accurate.
