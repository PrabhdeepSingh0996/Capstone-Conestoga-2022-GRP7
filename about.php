            G1 Boost began as a learning strategy for G1 exams in Ontario, using quizzes to help people prepare. We started this project because we wanted to help people interactively learn about the test by simulating the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            G1 Boost is a quiz application that helps users understand the test by practicing hands-on in it. We are using the official G1 Ontario quiz sample papers to generate the questions, so the quiz is very accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a team of 3 people using our knowledge of web design to make this project a reality. To get to know more about us, please visit the contact page.
